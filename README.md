Hexapawn
========

This is a single-player vs. computer implementation of the mathematical game Hexapawn (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexapawn). The implementation uses a Java Swing GUI, and a genetic type algorithm to guide the computers descision making against the player.  The algorithm learns to play the game by examining moves from previous games that do not result in a loss.  The most common of these moves will be the most common moves for the computer.

Usage
-----

*Note* Currently designed for usage in Mac/Linux environments. Windows build support expeected soon.
